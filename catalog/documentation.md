## Usage

Account Maturity is a New Relic Open Source app that provides a quick view into the quality of your New Relic implementation. It measures key governance areas such as:

- instrumentation coverage
- alert coverage
- tag usage

Account Maturity generates scored results in these, and other, categories for configurable collections of your New Relic data. Use these scores to identify and remediate gaps in your observability.

Visit the [User Guide](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-account-maturity/blob/main/docs/guide/index.md) for full details on using Account Maturity.
