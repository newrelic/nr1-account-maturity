# New Relic - Account Maturity
![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-nerdpack-layout-standard?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-nerdpack-layout-standard/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-nerdpack-layout-standard)

This New Relic One app is designed to make use of some of the available APIs to understand how well you may be using your account and the features that may provide value to you within New Relic's services. It uses the power of the GraphQL API to understand account structure and can provide some detailed information for master and sub-accounts and how they are being utilised.

The goal of this app is not to create a critical voice on your account usage but to highlight functionality which perhaps you were not aware was un-used or disabled. It is a guide and the scores are merely a guage alongside to provide a measure. We don't expect the majority of the users of this app to achieve 100% scores but they certainly can be goals for a number of the important features.

#### What's included?
- APM Feature Usage
- Browser Feature Usage

Further products will be added as this app evolves.

## Usage

The usage of this New Relic App is quite simple. Follow the Getting Started guide to publish, deploy and subscribe your account to this Nerdpack. If you want the app to be able to see sub-accounts, deploy at the master account level. It will only show data from accounts that a user is named/permitted on, so users of a sub-account B won't be able to see sub-account A if they are not named users on that account.
